## Introduction
---

This is part of Trilogy Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development - Task is to build a travel website using Bootstrap components.

## Client Brief 

---

Hello, we are Travel California and we need a website developer to bring our vision of our new webpage to life. Our in-house designer did a pretty good job, but feel free to tweak our design if you feel like you have ideas that can make us better.

We like:

- Strong, legible fonts.
- Clear, well-defined sections.
- Lifestyle imagery that shows off the sights and scenery of California. The imagery must be crisp and make our viewers want to explore California.

Ways you can contribute:

Many of our sections could use extra UI elements or features. Everything looks nice, but we wouldnâ€™t mind more ways to interact with the webpage.
Color scheme: If you want to explore another color palette, feel free! But try to stick to the style we have laid out in the design.
Our typography looks nice, but we are always open to other suggestions. Maybe you can add a font that feels more... adventurous?

## Developers Note

Client has already provided wireframes and these will be used to design this webpage.
